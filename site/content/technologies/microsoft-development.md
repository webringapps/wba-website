content: >-
  We love opensource and we love .NET! Until recently these two worlds did not
  go smooth together. Since .NET Core we are glad to finally see .NET going
  opensource. It gave lot of developers an option to port their products to
  other platforms and to bring .NET into new state of art.


  We still support plain old .NET because most of projects out there still
  depend on it
